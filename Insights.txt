Insights, collected on the way

* Metropolis Sampling
    + works
    - one needs to guess some temperature
    + too many temperatures do not harm
    + one easily (automated by a script) sees if there are not enough
    + it is easy to calculate more
    - does not equilibrate for negative temperatures near zero for walks
      without bounds, eg. gaussian, especially in high dimensions

* Wang Landau Sampling
    + yields very nice results
    + no need for post processing
    + needs not parameters like temperatures
    + works well for Gaussian Walks and Levy Flights where
      Metropolis does not equilibrate
    - takes virtually (and probably also literally) forever,
      especially for the self avoiding types and small values of
      the observable
    + can be mitigated by calculation of smaller parts without the
      extremely degenerate cases at 0 and maximum (for lattice Walks)
    - difficult to find the first and last bin
      they are good, if the simulation terminates
      -> maybe extract from previous Metropolis simulations?
    o flatness criterion should be >= 0.8, otherwise systematic errors
    o f_final not so important, mainly statistical error

* Gaussian random walks
    - do not equilibrate for small theta

* Levy Walks
    - do not work with Metropolis sampling
    - do not work with Wang Landau sampling and smaller energy ranges

* Scaling
    o works better for real valued walks than lattice walks (maybe better for N -> infty)
    o scaling for volume seems to be A/N**(d*\nu)
    o scaling for surface seems to be L/N**((d-1)*\nu)
    o scaling for a d-dimensional observable: S/N**(d*\nu)
    + this ist the expected scaling (see first site of 10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.140602)
    - extreme corrections to scaling for small N at the peak -> in the tail parallel but not collapsed
    o scaling exponent \kappa seems to be \kappa = 1/(d*\nu)

* Histogram Types for Metropolis
    - linear scale is very bad for "left side"
    - percentile based bins show weird artifacts (steps, ..)
    + log scale is well suited for rate function
