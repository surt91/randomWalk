Insights, collected on the way

* Metropolis Sampling
    + works
    - one needs to guess some temperature
    + too many temperatures do not harm
    + one easily (automated by a script) sees if there are not enough
    + it is easy to calculate more

* Wang Landau Sampling
    + yields very nice results
    + no need for post processing
    + needs not parameters like temperatures
    - take virtually (and probably also literally) forever,
      especially for the self avoiding types

* Gaussian random walks
    - do not equilibrate for small theta

* Scaling
    o works better for real valued walks than lattice walks (maybe better for N -> infty)
